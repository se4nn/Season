  <section class="event intro">
    <h3>For my (actual) inaugural supper club, we’re exploring the foodie half of my heritage, Armenia.</h3>
    <p>Armenia is a country with a rich history and scarred past. It has been the subject of multiple invasions, is currently in the longest running war in the world, was the first country to break free from Soviet rule, and was subject to a particularly horrendous (but not talked about) genocide.</p>
    <p>Our food this Season will be based on the dishes from the area – more specifically some of the dishes Granny used to cook. I've tried to balance the Cypriot influence in some of her cooking, with the original Armenian slant but I’ll let you tell me what you think to them.</p>

    <h2>The Menu</h2>
    <div class="menu-item">
      <div class="menu-item-title"><h3>Lahmajoun</h3><p class="allergens mono">GF</p></div>
      <p>(~Leck-ma-jun) - Are the “Armenian Pizzas”, as my mum once sold them to me.</p>
      <p>Minced pork and beef on a thin pastry, with chopped tomatoes and onion, served with plenty of fresh parsley and a wedge of lemon (squeeze this on top just before serving, much like a taco).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="menu-item">
      <div class="menu-item-title"><h3>Granny’s Salad</h3><p class="allergens mono">VG GF</p></div>
      <p>As we know, Granny served a salad with every single meal she made. It was generally the same, and it was blood delicious. I’ve chopped it about a bit but the essence and dressing remain true to the original.</p>
      <p>Thinly slice white lettuce, chunks of tomato, finely chopped cucumber served with a classic (but secret) lemon vinaigrette dressing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="menu-item">
      <div class="menu-item-title"><h3>Cyprus Potatoes</h3><p class="allergens mono">VG GF</p></div>
      <p>Another common accompaniment (and famous to anyone who’s ever been to Cyprus) are their crispy chip style roast potatoes. They’re crispy, lemony, garlicky and salty, what’s not to like? These will be served hot, on-top of a garlicky yoghurt.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="menu-item">
      <div class="menu-item-title"><h3>Cheese — Cake</h3><p class="allergens mono">V N GF</p></div>
      <p>The basis of this dessert is a Galomberama – an eggless and butter-free cake made with semolina instead of flour. To top it off, I’ve added a nod to one of the first desserts I ever made - Angel Delight. </p>
      <p>Galomberama sponge with a roasted peach half, topped with whipped mascarpone, a drizzle of maple syrup and finished a mix of toasted pecans and hazelnuts.</p>

    <h2>The Meal</h2>
    <p>I will be playing host for the meal, presenting a full selection of all the dishes I plan to cook the week after.</p>
    <p>We'll get started at about 2:00pm with food being served from the get go, I'm really looking forward to cooking for you all!</p>
