  <section class="event intro">
    <h3>For my inaugural supper club, we’re exploring the foodie half of my heritage, Armenia.</h3>
    <p>Armenia is a country with a rich history and scarred past. It has been the subject of multiple invasions, is currently in the longest running war in the world, was the first country to break free from Soviet rule, and was subject to a particularly horrendous (but not talked about) genocide.</p>
    <p>Our food this Season will be based on the dishes from the area – more specifically some of the dishes my Granny used to cook. My maternal grandparents fled Armenia and headed to Cyprus during the 1920s, creating a noticeable Cypriot influence in some of her dishes. I’ve taken the core flavours of her cuisine and tried to give it my own twist, elevating some flavours and sprinkling in some new ones – adding acid, heat and more to give the flavour profiles a touch more balance.</p>

    <h2>The Menu</h2>
    <div class="menu-item">
      <div class="menu-item-title"><h3>Lahmajoun</h3></div>
      <p>(~Leck-ma-jun) - Are the “Armenian Pizzas”, as my mum once sold them to me.</p>
      <p>Minced pork and beef on a thin pastry, with chopped tomatoes and onion, served with plenty of fresh parsley and a wedge of lemon (squeeze this on top just before serving, much like a taco).</p>
    </div>
    <div class="menu-item">
      <div class="menu-item-title"><h3>Moussaka <span>(kinda)</span></h3><p class="allergens mono">V GF</p></div>
      <p>Moussaka was always dished up with potatoes in my house (due to mine and my sister’s point blank refusal to eat aubergine) – so this is my twist on a moussaka, inspired by my mum.</p>
      <p>Roast aubergine, topped with a cheddar crisp, on a bed of stewed tomato, onion and spices, served with fresh yoghurt and lavash to dip.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="menu-item">
      <div class="menu-item-title"><h3>Granny’s Salad</h3><p class="allergens mono">VG GF</p></div>
      <p>My Granny served a salad with every single meal she made. It was generally the same, and it was blood delicious. I’ve chopped it about a bit but the essence and dressing remain true to the original.</p>
      <p>Thinly slice white lettuce, radicchio, chunks of tomato, finely chopped cucumber served with a classic (but secret) lemon vinaigrette dressing.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="menu-item">
      <div class="menu-item-title"><h3>Cyprus Potatoes</h3><p class="allergens mono">VG GF</p></div>
      <p>Another common accompaniment (and famous to anyone who’s ever been to Cyprus) are their crispy chip style roast potatoes. They’re crispy, lemony, garlicky and salty, what’s not to like?</p>
    </div>
    <div class="menu-item">
      <div class="menu-item-title"><h3>Cheese — Cake</h3><p class="allergens mono">V N</p></div>
      <p>The basis of this dessert is a Galomberama – an eggless and butter-free cake made with semolina instead of flour. To top it off, I’ve added a nod to one of the first desserts I ever made - Angel Delight. </p>
      <p>Galomberama sponge with a roasted peach half, topped with whipped mascarpone, a drizzle of maple syrup and finished a mix of toasted pecans and hazelnuts.</p>
